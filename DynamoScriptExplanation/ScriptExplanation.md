# PedSimAutomation Dynamo Script

This document details the dynamo script used in the repository [_PedSimAutomation_](https://github.com/patrickberggold/PedSimAutomation/).
A screenshot of the script is presented below. ![Cannot find screenshot of script. Make sure it is in the same folder.](script_screenshot.png)

The script is divided into two code paths: _Geometry Creation_ and _Forward Pass_.
Switching between both paths can be done via the first setting of the Forward Pass path: _CreateFloorPlanWithOverlaidZones_, shown in a screenshot below. ![Cannot find image. Make sure it is in the same folder.](CreateFloorPlanWithOverlaidZones.png)
